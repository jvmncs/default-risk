### Introduction and Proposal Document

### Installation
It's recommended that you install PyTorch according to the directions [here](https://pytorch.org/) using your preferred package manager.  There's a requirements.txt file you can check out, but unfortunately using PyTorch means that you likely won't be able to install everything with that (since PyTorch has prebuilt binaries for each platform).

### Dependencies

- python 3.6
- torch 0.4.0
- pytest 3.6.3

More will be added to this list as time goes on.  Please take dependency complexity into consideration when choosing which tools to use for your development and analysis! If there's an existing dependency that covers what you're trying to do, consider the tradeoffs involved with using that tool instead.
